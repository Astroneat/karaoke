# Karaoke V2

## Installations

- Create a python virtual environment:
```py
python -m venv env
```

- Install the required packages:
```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Change `SONG_NAME` in `main.py` to whatever song you want to play, and enjoy!
- Things you can do (very cool!):
  - Change `SEARCH_SONG` to `False` and edit `SONG_FILE` to play any custom audio you want.
  - Same with `SEARCH_LYRICS` and `LYRICS_FILE`.
  - More configurations can be changed in `main.py`.

## Issues

- Some songs have really badly synced lyrics, I can't really fix this since it's the lyric providers' fault, not mine.
- Please report any issues you see with the program, I will *try my best* to fix it.
